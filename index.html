                My name is Mohammad Ahnaf Asif. I am an HSC graduate student. I have achieved overall 7.0 in IELTS. Now, I am looking forward to going to Canada for pursuing higher education. In my opinion, 2022 is the glittering light to brighten the dream-lined pathway
                of future. At the same time, 2022 will be challenging for me because of some reasons.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                My mission in 2022 is to reach in Canada as an international student. Canada is one of the most helpful countries in the world as far as study and immigration are concerned. However, in 2022, my ultimate mission is to make parents & entire extended family
                happy and proud.

            <h3> Vision </h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                My vision in 2022 is to begin a new journey in Toronto. This is because I have already received "Letter of Acceptance" from Seneca College for "CPA-Computer Programming and Analysis". In 2022, I want to start my higher education on a higher node.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                My ambition in life is to become an established person in the world and 2022 will be the most crucial year for me. This is because in 2022, I will start my higher education and after completing my graduation, hopefully I will become a skilled, expert
                and flawless programmer.

                The world is getting competitive day by day. To stay in the race, we all should enhance ourselves by learning new skills like web-development, problem-solving etc. We can not think a single day without modern technology. Hence, we all should learn the
                basic knowledge about technology. For example: How to operate a desktop or laptop PC, smart-phone etc. In the learning period, we may face some adversities. But, it is our own duty to overcome these obstacles.

                If anyone study abroad, he/she tends to mix with differnt people from all around the globe. In that case, every international students should have some basic information about various language, culture, caste, social - prejudices etc. This habit will
                definitely help the students to cope-up quickly with the new circumstances in fact, an alien situation.
